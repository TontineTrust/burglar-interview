# Burglar Interview

Imagine you are a burglar trying to steal a precious diamond without the alarm
going off. In order to prevent you from stealing the diamond, several motion
sensors were put in place in the room which trigger the alarm. However, you, the
software engineer you are, managed to hack into the museum's servers and found
the blueprint, listing the location of each motion sensor. The motion sensors
are each built to trigger the alarm when you come too close to them, with
probability

```
P = exp[-l^2 / L^2]
```

where `l` is the distance between you and the sensor, and `L` is some length
characteristic of the type of sensor.

Now, given that you know exactly where each sensor is, your task is to prepare
for the robbery by calculating exactly which path you should take to get through
the room with the lowest chance of triggering the alarm, and steal the diamond.

Given parameters:
- The room is of size `M` x `N`, with `M` and `N` given parameters.
- The diamond is located at the center of the room, `(M/2, N/2)`.
- The entrance is at the bottom right corner, `(M, 0)`, and the exit at the top
  left corner, `(0, N)`.
- You have a list of sensor locations `(m_i, n_i)`.

Your algorithm should give the probability of being caught taking the ideal path
from the entrance via the diamond to the exit. All of this should be put in a
Haskell repository on GitHub, which you invite me to, that uses cabal, nix,
stack or whichever tools you like. Tests are not necessary, but a readme file
is, where you describe the formulae that you are using in your code, come from.

The goal of this exercise, is to test
- your ability to solve problemms
- your communication skills, including documentation and the readme
- the quality of your code itself, readability, modularity etc.

Particularly, I also want you to discuss any important choices you made in terms
of the usage of algorithms, data structures and time/space complexity in the
readme.

This task should take you 4-8 hours. Please don't work longer on it than this,
we really don't want you to waste too much time.

Good luck, and enjoy!
